# Calley App
 Here I have used every navigator option available and combine them in a single project to create a seemless user navigation experience for the app user.  Then I have created some extra things such as login, signup &amp; splash screen and provided an authentication flow using AsycStorage. Also I have created form validation for the login screen.
# Project Demo!
